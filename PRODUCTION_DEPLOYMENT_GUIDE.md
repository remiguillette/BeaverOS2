# Production Deployment Guide for BeaverTalk API

## Current Status Summary

### ✅ What's Working (Local Development)
- All BeaverTalk API endpoints are fully functional
- Authentication system is working correctly
- Database operations are successful
- Security features are active
- Message filtering and validation are working

### ❌ What Needs Deployment (Production Server)
- BeaverTalk API endpoints need to be deployed to `https://rgbeavernet.ca`
- Environment variables need to be configured
- Database connection needs to be established
- Authentication needs to be configured

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare for Production Deployment

The application is ready for production deployment. The following commands will build and deploy the application:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Push database schema to production
npm run db:push
```

### 2. Required Environment Variables

Set these environment variables on the production server:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

### 3. API Endpoints That Will Be Available After Deployment

Once deployed, these endpoints will be available at `https://rgbeavernet.ca`:

- `GET /api/chat/health` - Health check for BeaverTalk API
- `POST /api/chat/sessions` - Create new chat sessions
- `GET /api/chat/sessions` - List all chat sessions
- `PATCH /api/chat/sessions/:sessionId` - Update session status
- `POST /api/chat/messages` - Send messages
- `GET /api/chat/messages/:sessionId` - Get messages for session
- `GET /api/chat/security-logs` - View security logs

### 4. RGRA Website Integration

After deployment, update the RGRA website environment variables:

```bash
VITE_BEAVERTALK_API_URL=https://rgbeavernet.ca/api/chat
VITE_BEAVERTALK_USERNAME=remiguillette
VITE_BEAVERTALK_PASSWORD=MC44rg99qc@
```

### 5. Test Commands for Production

After deployment, test with these commands:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl -u "remiguillette:MC44rg99qc@" "https://rgbeavernet.ca/api/chat/health"

# Test session creation
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u "remiguillette:MC44rg99qc@" \
  -d '{"sessionId":"prod-test-001","userName":"Production Test","status":"active","priority":"normal","category":"general"}' \
  "https://rgbeavernet.ca/api/chat/sessions"

# Test message sending
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u "remiguillette:MC44rg99qc@" \
  -d '{"sessionId":"prod-test-001","senderName":"Test User","senderType":"user","messageContent":"Production test message"}' \
  "https://rgbeavernet.ca/api/chat/messages"
```

## Security Features

The production deployment includes:

- **HTTP Basic Authentication** for all API endpoints
- **Content Security Analysis** with automatic threat detection
- **Input Validation** using Zod schemas
- **IP Address Tracking** for all requests
- **Security Logging** for suspicious activity
- **Session Management** with proper status tracking

## Database Schema

The production database will include these tables:
- `chat_sessions` - Chat session management
- `chat_messages` - Message storage with security scoring
- `chat_security_logs` - Security event tracking

## Monitoring and Maintenance

After deployment, monitor:
- API response times
- Error rates
- Security log entries
- Database performance
- Authentication success rates

## Troubleshooting

If the API doesn't work after deployment:

1. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify the database connection
3. Confirm the API endpoints are accessible
4. Check the server logs for errors
5. Test authentication with the provided credentials

## Summary

The BeaverTalk API is fully developed and tested in the local environment. All endpoints are functional, security features are active, and the system is ready for production deployment. Once deployed to `https://rgbeavernet.ca`, the RGRA website integration will work seamlessly.
