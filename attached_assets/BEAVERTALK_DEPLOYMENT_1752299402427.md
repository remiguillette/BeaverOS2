# BeaverTalk Chat Widget Deployment Guide

## Overview

The BeaverTalk chat widget has been integrated into the RGRA website and is ready for deployment. The widget connects to the real BeaverTalk API system for live chat support.

## Environment Variables Setup

To deploy the chat widget with the real BeaverTalk API, you need to set these environment variables:

```bash
# BeaverTalk API Configuration
VITE_BEAVERTALK_API_URL=https://your-beavernet-domain.com/api/chat
VITE_BEAVERTALK_USERNAME=remiguillette
VITE_BEAVERTALK_PASSWORD=MC44rg99qc@
```

## Current Status

**✅ COMPLETED**: Chat widget is fully integrated and ready for deployment  
**⚠️ PENDING**: BeaverTalk API endpoints need to be deployed on the server

### Testing Results

The chat widget has been successfully integrated with:
- Environment variable configuration ✅
- Connection testing and error handling ✅
- Professional UI with status indicators ✅

**Current Issue**: The BeaverTalk API server at `https://rgbeavernet.ca` is returning HTML instead of JSON, indicating the API endpoints are not yet deployed.

### Next Steps for Full Deployment

1. **Deploy BeaverTalk API endpoints** on the server at `https://rgbeavernet.ca`
2. **Ensure these endpoints are available**:
   - `GET /api/chat/health` - Health check
   - `POST /api/chat/sessions` - Create sessions
   - `POST /api/chat/messages` - Send messages
   - `GET /api/chat/messages/{sessionId}` - Get messages
   - `PATCH /api/chat/sessions/{sessionId}/status` - Update session status

## Testing

Before deployment, test the connection by:

1. Opening the chat widget
2. Verifying the connection status shows "Connected"
3. Sending a test message
4. Confirming messages are sent and received properly

## Troubleshooting

If the widget shows "Connection Failed":

1. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify the BeaverTalk API URL is accessible
3. Confirm the username and password are correct
4. Check network connectivity
5. Use the "Retry" button to reconnect

## Production Deployment

Once environment variables are configured:

1. The widget will automatically connect to the real BeaverTalk API
2. No simulation messages will be generated
3. All chat sessions will be logged in the BeaverTalk system
4. Real support agents can respond to inquiries
