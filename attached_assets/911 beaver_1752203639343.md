# **911 CAD System Reference Guide**

## **1.0 Overview**

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the setup, integration, and use of the 911 Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) system. It covers database mapping, API data structures, call-taking protocols, and integrated modules.

## **2.0 Database Synchronization & Mapping**

The CAD system can synchronize with your external database to pull character, vehicle, and license information in real-time. Proper mapping is crucial for this feature to function correctly.

### **2.1 Character Data Mapping**

Your primary character data should be stored in a single database table.

* **Table Name:** The name of your database table containing character records (e.g., characters).  
* **Character Mapping Column:** This column must contain a **unique identifier** for each character (e.g. license\_id). This ID is used to link a character to their vehicle, license, and property records.  
* **Data Columns:** Other columns in the table map to specific character fields (e.g., firstname, lastname, dateofbirth).

Example:  
In a characters table, the identifier column holds the unique ID, firstname holds the first name, and so on. The system can also pull data from other tables (e.g., a properties table) if they share the same unique character identifier column.

### **2.2 License and Vehicle Mapping**

Vehicle and license records are stored in their own tables and linked back to a character via the unique identifier.

* **Vehicle Table:** A table containing vehicle records (e.g., owned\_vehicles).  
  * **Owner Column:** Contains the character's unique ID to establish ownership.  
  * **Plate Column:** Contains the vehicle's license plate.  
* **License Table:** A table containing license records, also linked by the character's unique ID.

### **2.3 Value Mapping**

The system allows you to map raw database values to more user-friendly display names within the CAD interface.

**Example:**

* A raw database value of drive\_license can be mapped to display as Driver's License.  
* A raw database value of cardealer can be mapped to display as Car Dealer.

### **2.4 Unit Information**

Unit information can also be synced from your database. The following fields are supported:

* UNIT\_NUMBER  
* UNIT\_NAME  
* UNIT\_RANK  
* UNIT\_AGENCY  
* UNIT\_DEPARTMENT  
* UNIT\_SUBDIVISION  
* UNIT\_AGENCY\_LOCATION  
* UNIT\_AGENCY\_ZIP  
* UNIT\_LOCATION

## **3.0 API Reference**

The CAD system exposes an API to retrieve record information in a structured JSON format.

### **3.1 API Errors**

If an API request fails, one of the following error messages will be returned:

* INVALID REQUEST TYPE: The HTTP method or request format was incorrect.  
* INVALID COMMUNITY ID: The provided community identifier is not valid.  
* API IS NOT ENABLED FOR THIS COMMUNITY: The API feature has not been activated for your community.  
* INVALID API KEY: The API key used for authentication is incorrect or has expired.  
* INVALID EMPTY SEARCH: The search query was empty or invalid.

### **3.2 API Data Structures**

The following JSON structures are used for different record types. The root object contains arrays for each type.

  "bolos": \[\],
